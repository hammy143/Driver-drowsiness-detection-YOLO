Driver Drowsiness Detection using YOLO
Detect and prevent driver drowsiness in real-time with this Python-based project using YOLO (You Only Look Once) for object detection. Drowsy driving is a significant safety concern, and this project aims to enhance road safety by monitoring the driver's behavior through a YOLO-based approach, issuing alerts when signs of drowsiness are detected.

Features
Real-time Monitoring: Continuous monitoring of the driver's facial features through webcam access.
YOLO Model: Utilize YOLO for accurate and efficient object detection, specifically trained for drowsiness detection.
Alert System: Visual and audible alerts to notify the driver when signs of drowsiness are identified.
Installation
Clone the Repository:

Use the command git clone to copy the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory.
Install Dependencies:

Install the required Python dependencies using the pip install command.
Download Trained YOLO Model:

Download the pre-trained YOLO model specifically trained for drowsiness detection and place it in the models/ directory.
Run the Application:

Execute the drowsiness detection script with the appropriate command.
Usage
Collect Training Data (Optional):

If you want to train the YOLO model further, collect and organize labeled training data.
Train the Model (Optional):

Train the YOLO model using the provided training script.
Run the Detection:

Run the drowsiness detection script to monitor the driver in real-time.
